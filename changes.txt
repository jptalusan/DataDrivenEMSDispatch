steps:
    python 2 to 3
    change prints
    removed pip versions
    docker compose => mongo, no auth
    mongo compass connect
    launch.json -> debugging
    pickle read -> utils = pickle.load(input_file, fix_imports=True, encoding='latin1')
    incidentsPlot -> google maps to leaflet (for now)
    ~pymongo credentials if needed (not needed now)
    mongo db: fire_department, collections: geo_incidents ~# simple_incidents, depot_details, newStations2019,  etc...
    googlemaps api -> ask David, or change to leaflet for now.
    
questions:
    update_services: Is this to read the raw xml file? so we assume we already have the data in mongo format.
    socket.emit -> socket.on in js.
